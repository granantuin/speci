Project Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of issuing a SPECI report (a special weather observation) within an hour at various airports using machine learning models. The models are trained on data from METAR observations, meteorological variables from the WRF model, and other relevant features. The prediction models are then deployed using a Streamlit application.
